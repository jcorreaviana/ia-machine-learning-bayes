# An example of Machine Learning using scikit-learn

This is a simple example of Machine Learning using Statistic Paradigm whith [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library

## The Naive Bayes - One of many approaches

We use here a MultinomialNB. You can learn more:

- About the Math of [Multinomial Naive Bayes](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html#multinomial-naive-bayes)
- Parameters and properties of [MuntinomialNB function is scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html)

### About the problem

This example simulate a buyer profile, trying simulate witch one is the classification of clients through history of shopping.

See that the classification of tests is used only for analyse the accurrace rate (or error rate) based in the trainning and predict result of the tests.

Try change some profile or classification in ```testClassification = [1,1,1,0,0,0]``` for example and see what happens.

After that, change another characteristics, and test if this impact the result.

So, let's learn! 8-)
